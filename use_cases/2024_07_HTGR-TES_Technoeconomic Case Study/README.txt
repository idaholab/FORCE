The optimal sizes of nuclear-TES systems are examined based on 24-hour to 219-hour bases.Before running HERON cases, the corresponding ARMA file (arma.pk) must be generated. For details on generating these files, please refer to the RAVEN wiki (https://github.com/idaholab/raven/wiki/runningRAVEN). HERON input files are in ./HERONFiles. Iput XML files generate RAVEN inner.xml and outer.xml files, optimizing components’ dispatch and size, respectively. To run these input files, HERON must be installed as part of the RAVEN plugin (https://github.com/idaholab/HERON/wiki).   For each folder/file naming as follows:./ARMA  The Raven input file for synthetic data is labeled as ARMA_train_{Selected Node/Zone}_{Synthetic History Year Configuration}_{segment length}. Historical real-time market data is formatted as {Selected Node/Zone}_realtime_hourly_{year}. The output file folder is formatted as Output_{Input Historical Start Year}_{Input Historical End Year}.Note: Market data are trained under identical Fourier detrending settings. If specific Fourier modes are added, they are indicated as F{additional added Fourier mode} in output file folders../HERON The file name follows the following format: <HERONmode>_<ReactorType><#ofARMAsampleGenerated><initialStorageLevel><MARKET>_<PivotLength>. If there are multiple result files (e.g., sweep.csv) in the folder, it indicates that the job aborted due to an error, and there were multiple attempts made to complete the job. Note: The optimization flow mainly consists of two parts: (1) In sweep mode, a combination set of optimal capacities for each superset is found, which will be used to define bounds (<opt_bounds>) in Heron input, and the initial values (<initial>) in the resulting output.xml for the optimization run. (2) In opt mode, a final set of capacities is determined, which will be utilized in the subsequent transient analysis (e.g., Dymola).
