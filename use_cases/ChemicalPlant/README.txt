data used to train ARMA roms are in the data folder
raven input files to train the ARMA roms are in the train folder
HERON inputs files for this use case are in the run folder

HERON input files are modified versions of those used in the DOW CRADA 
report.  The large plant has two input files.  Both can be used to 
select the appropriate reactor technology for the plant integration.  
One is an optimization case with a continuous reactor capacity, the other 
is a sweep of fixed reactor capacities. The small plant also has two 
HERON input files, a optimization and sweep.  In which the reactor and 
thermal energy storage capacities are being evaluated.
