The following are tests for the Aspen HYSYS/ Aspen APEA/HERON integration.
Since this integration typically requires developing cost functions of different components, scripts that produce cost functions are included too.

1- Aspen_HERON_FullTest
2- create_APEA_Comps
3-create_FORCE_Comps
4-create_HYSYS_Comps
5-create HYSYS_Comps
6-HERON_update_withCompSets


# Definitions
# "Force Component": a component whose attributes are imported from two (or more) IES codes
# "Component set": a set of components grouped together to be represented later as one component


The full test is "Aspen_HERON_FullTest". The other tests are intermediate steps.
